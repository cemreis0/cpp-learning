/*
radix is the number of possibilities for each position;
the digits in a number system.

radix sort is not a comparison sort, therefore
we cannot analyze the amount of work done in terms
of comparisons.

the idea behind is to divide values to be sorted
into as many subgroups as there are possible
alternatives for each position in the key.
